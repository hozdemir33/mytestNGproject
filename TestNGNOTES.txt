Parallel Testing:
> 1. Do you know parallel testing?
-Yes, i know.
----------
> 2. How do you do parallel testing?

-In my TestNG framework:
    - I create xml files to run tests in parallel using parallel and thread-count
    - Alternatively, we can use data provider to run tests in parallel using parallel
    and data-provider-thread-count
-----------

Note: In cucumber we are going to use special plugin. Cucumber parallel testing is harder than testng.

> 3. What is thread-count ?
-Thread means the code. It will be same as the number of browsers.
-----------
> 4. What is thread-safe ?
-It means synchronized codes. In thead-safe code, we can run multiple codes in parallel.
-TestNG is thread-safe. It let us do parallel testing with no issue.
-----------
>5. Why do you do parallel testing?
-To save time
-We normally do not do parallel testing for one test. But, when there are multiple test cases,
then we do parallel testing to save a lot of time.

-For example, I have a parallel test suite for my smoke test.

-We also have a suite for regression tests to run in parallel.

-I also have some end2end test suite that I can run in parallel.

-I have a few small class that i run in parallel using data provider.
For example, for my login tests, I have multiple credentials
that i use for the parallel testing.
